# PCA using python

## What is PCA
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a mathematical tool used to transform a dataset into a lower-dimensional space while retaining most of the information present in the original data. It accomplishes this by identifying a set of new variables, called principal components, which are linear combinations of the original variables. These new variables are chosen in such a way that they capture the maximum amount of variability in the data.
